# Hyly Extension Sandbox - Execution Plan

See ../../../hyly-extension/templates/INSTRUCTIONS-TASKS.md for task format and execution guidelines.

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** After completing EACH task, you MUST:
1. Replace â¬œ with âœ… and add timestamp `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`  
2. Add numbered "Completion notes:" section describing what was done
3. Continue to next â¬œ task immediately - do not stop until ALL tasks complete
